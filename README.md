This is my website portfolio. I'm starting this project to keep my coding skills up, and to present myself professionally in my own fun way without having to create a generic resume. My end goal for this project is to have a couple pages showing my skills, certifications, little bit about me and to have a blog.

Project started on: 29 April 2025
